# OeuvresRoudApp 

## Basic info

Web development for the project [Gustave Roud, *Œuvres complètes*](https://www.unil.ch/clsr/home/menuinst/projets-de-recherche/gustave-roud-oeuvres-completes.html). The aim is to build a digital edition of Roud's complete works in an Angular web application.

The back-end framework used is [Knora](knora.org/). Project specific ontologies and lists are available in a Platec (DaSCH@Unil) [repo](https://github.com/LaDHUL/oeuvres-roud).

API requests to Knora are handled using the JavaScript library *knora-api-js-lib* ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@knora/api) | [doc](https://dasch-swiss.github.io/knora-api-js-lib/) | [github](https://github.com/dasch-swiss/knora-api-js-lib)).

## Prototype

During the first year of the project, in 2018, we created a [prototype](https://espadini.gitbook.io/roudwebappprototype) of the web application. This was presented to the publishing house that will produce the paper edition ([Zoé](http://www.editionszoe.ch/)) and used as a foundation for the web development.

## How it works

#### Knora ui

[Knora ui](https://dasch-swiss.github.io/knora-ui/) provides out of the shelf front-end modules. It is a work in progress by the [DaSCH](dasch.swiss/) and it is not yet used in this project. The way the environments is set in our app is compliant with Knora ui though, to make possible future integrations.

#### Style

Bootstrap can be used. This section to be updated ...
Most of these things will be obvious for developers, but for non developers:

- `yalc` and `node_modules` contain all the libraries used in the project
- `src` is where most of the things happen
- `src/assets` contains localization data (multilingual)
- `src/config` defines the *dev* and *prod* connection configurations
- `src/environments` defines if *dev* or *prod* should be used.

#### Pipes

Names should be self explanatory, but comments are provided in each of the ts files. These are the pipes used in the code:

- HTML sanitizer;
- encodeURIComponent;
- Knora dates formatting.

#### Directives

See comments in the files for more info.

- resource-link: it applies to links inside a text, which are just IRI, to trigger the redirection to the right class of resources.
- page-link: used to sync facsimile pages to the pages in the texts.



## A work in progress

Issue [#12](https://github.com/gustaveroudproject/roud-oeuvres-app/issues/12) summarizes the tasks to be completed.

What follows is the doc automatically generated by Angular.

## Angular
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.8.

#### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

#### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

#### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

#### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

#### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

#### Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
